# Setup Wizard - Complete Specification

## Overview

The Setup Wizard is the primary installation and management interface for the Lazy_Birtd game development automation system. It transforms a complex multi-phase setup into a simple, interactive process that takes 15-30 minutes for initial installation.

## Design Philosophy

1. **Zero-knowledge required** - Anyone can install without reading documentation
2. **Safe by default** - Validates before installing, backs up before changing
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, add complexity only when needed
4. **Self-healing** - Detects and fixes common problems automatically
5. **Transparent** - Shows what it's doing and why

## Core Components

### 1. System Detection Engine

**Purpose:** Automatically detect system capabilities and requirements

**Detection Points:**
```bash
# Hardware
- RAM available (total and free)
- CPU cores
- Disk space (/, /tmp, project directory)
- GPU availability (for Godot editor)

# Software
- OS type and version (Ubuntu/Debian/Arch/Manjaro/WSL2)
- Docker/Podman installation
- systemd availability
- Godot installation (version, location)
- Claude Code CLI (installed, version, working)
- Git (version, config)
- Python 3 (version 3.8+)

# Project
- Godot project location
- Project version (Godot 3 vs 4)
- Existing test framework (GUT, gdUnit4, WAT, none)
- Git repository (local, remote URL)
- Existing CI/CD (detect .gitlab-ci.yml, .github/workflows)

# Network
- GitHub/GitLab accessibility
- API token validity
- ntfy.sh reachability
- Docker registry access
```

**Detection Script: `scripts/wizard/detect.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Returns JSON with all detected values
{
  "hardware": {
    "ram_total_gb": 16,
    "ram_free_gb": 12,
    "cpu_cores": 8,
    "disk_free_gb": 120
  },
  "software": {
    "os": "manjaro",
    "os_version": "23.1",
    "docker": true,
    "docker_version": "24.0.7",
    "systemd": true,
    "godot": "/usr/bin/godot",
    "godot_version": "4.2.1",
    "claude_code": true,
    "claude_version": "1.2.0",
    "git_version": "2.43.0",
    "python_version": "3.11.6"
  },
  "project": {
    "found": true,
    "path": "/home/user/my-game",
    "godot_version": "4.2",
    "test_framework": "none",
    "git_repo": true,
    "git_remote": "https://github.com/user/my-game.git"
  }
}
```

### 2. Claude Code Validator

**Purpose:** Verify Claude Code CLI works in headless mode

**Tests:**
```bash
# Test 1: Basic headless prompt
claude -p "Print hello world"

# Test 2: With dangerous flag (in container)
docker run --rm claude-test \
  claude -p "List files" --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Test 3: Output format
claude -p "Test" --output-format json

# Test 4: Tool restrictions
claude -p "Test" --allowedTools "Read"
```

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ All tests pass → Full automation possible
- ⚠️ Some fail → Limited automation, warn user
- ❌ All fail → Cannot proceed, show error

### 3. Interactive Questionnaire

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Installation Failures

**Rollback Strategy:**
```bash
# If installation fails at any step:
1. Stop all running services
2. Remove partial installations
3. Restore backed up files
4. Show detailed error log
5. Offer to retry or abort

# Logs saved to:
~/.config/lazy_birtd/logs/install-<timestamp>.log
```

**Common Failures & Solutions:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Claude Code not found" | CLI not installed | Show installation instructions |
| "Insufficient RAM" | < 8GB available | Suggest closing applications or upgrading |
| "Docker not running" | Docker daemon stopped | `systemctl start docker` |
| "API token invalid" | Wrong or expired token | Re-prompt for token |
| "Port 5000 in use" | Another service | Detect and offer alternative port |
| "Godot not found" | Not in PATH | Prompt for manual path |
| "Git repo not clean" | Uncommitted changes | Offer to stash or commit |

### Runtime Failures

**Self-Healing Capabilities:**

1. **Service Restart**
   ```bash
   # If Godot server crashes:
   - Detect via health check failure
   - Automatic restart (systemd handles this)
   - Alert user if restart fails 3 times
   - Offer to run --repair
   ```

2. **Worktree Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # If worktree operations fail:
   - Detect stuck/locked worktrees
   - Force removal with --force
   - Prune git worktree list
   - Verify main repo integrity
   ```

3. **Docker Recovery**
   ```bash
   # If agent container fails:
   - Capture error logs
   - Stop and remove container
   - Check Docker daemon health
   - Retry with fresh container
   - Alert after 3 failures
   ```

## Security Considerations

### Secret Management

**API Tokens:**
```bash
# Stored with restricted permissions
~/.config/lazy_birtd/secrets/
├── api_token (chmod 600)
├── vpn_key (chmod 600)
└── webhook_urls (chmod 600)

# Never committed to git
# Backed up separately
# Can be rotated via wizard
```

**Environment Isolation:**
```bash
# Claude agents run in Docker
# Limited access to:
- Project worktree only
- No access to secrets directory
- No network access (except git/API)
- Resource limits enforced
```

### Update Security

**Wizard Updates:**
```bash
# Verify updates before applying
- Check GPG signature of wizard.sh
- Compare SHA256 hash
- Option to review changes before install
- Rollback available for 30 days
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Arch)
- Native installation preferred
- systemd services
- Full feature support

### Windows WSL2
- Requires WSL2 (not WSL1)
- Docker Desktop for Windows
- systemd emulation via `systemd-genie`
- Some limitations on Phase 3 (VPN)

### macOS
- Docker Desktop required
- No systemd (use launchd)
- Experimental support (Phase 1-2 only)

## Testing the Wizard

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Test each component independently
tests/wizard/test_detection.sh
tests/wizard/test_validation.sh
tests/wizard/test_installation.sh
tests/wizard/test_upgrade.sh
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Full end-to-end wizard run
tests/wizard/integration_test.sh
# Uses:
- Disposable VM
- Mock Godot project
- Fake API responses
- Validates complete flow
```

### User Acceptance Testing
```bash
# Real user scenarios
1. Fresh install on clean system
2. Upgrade from Phase 1 to Phase 2
3. Repair after manual breakage
4. Uninstall and reinstall
5. Import/export configuration
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features (v2.0)
- Web-based wizard (alternative to CLI)
- Remote installation (install on VPS from laptop)
- Multi-project support (one wizard, many projects)
- Wizard API (programmatic access)
- Custom phase definitions (user-defined phases)
- Wizard plugins (community extensions)

### Telemetry (Opt-in)
```bash
# Anonymous usage stats
- Which phases are most popular
- Common failure points
- Average installation times
- Feature usage patterns

# User benefit:
