# Lazy_Birtd

**Automate game development with Claude Code while you're at work.**

Lazy_Birtd is a progressive automation system that lets Claude Code work on your Godot game projects autonomously. Create issues in the morning, review PRs at lunch, merge at night.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yusyus/lazy_birtd.git
cd lazy_birtd
./wizard.sh

# 2. Create a task
gh issue create --template task --title "Add player health system" --label "ready"

# 3. Watch it work
./wizard.sh --status
```

## Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous Development** - Claude Code works while you're away
- 🧪 **Automated Testing** - Runs gdUnit4 tests, retries on failure
- 🌿 **Safe Git Workflow** - Isolated worktrees, automatic PRs
- 📊 **Progress Monitoring** - Check status from phone via notifications
- 🔐 **Security First** - Secret management, containerized execution
- 📈 **Progressive Scaling** - Start simple (1 agent), scale to multiple

## How It Works

```
Morning (7-8am)          Work Hours                Lunch (12pm)        Evening (6pm)
─────────────────       ──────────────            ─────────────       ──────────────
Create GitHub Issues → Claude processes tasks  →  Review PRs      →  Merge & test
Add "ready" label       Runs tests automatically   Approve/comment     Deploy builds
Go to work              Creates PRs if passing     Back to work        Plan tomorrow
```

## Architecture

**Phase 1: Single Agent** (Start here)
- One task at a time, sequential processing
- 15-minute wizard setup, 8GB RAM
- Perfect for solo developers

**Phase 2: Multi-Agent** (Scale up)
- 2-3 agents working in parallel
- Godot Server coordinates test execution
- 16GB RAM recommended

**Phase 3+:** Remote access, CI/CD, enterprise features

## Requirements

- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Arch, Manjaro, etc.) or Windows WSL2
- Godot 4.2+
- Claude Code CLI
- GitHub or GitLab account
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended

## Installation

### One-Command Install

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yusyus/lazy_birtd/main/wizard.sh | bash
```

### Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yusyus/lazy_birtd.git
cd lazy_birtd

# Run Phase 0 validation (required)
./tests/phase0/validate-all.sh /path/to/your/godot-project

# If validation passes, run wizard
./wizard.sh
```

The wizard will:
- Detect your system capabilities
- Ask 8 simple questions
- Install appropriate phase
- Set up Godot Server
- Configure issue watcher
- Create issue templates
- Validate everything works

## Usage

### Creating Tasks

Create a GitHub/GitLab issue with detailed steps:

```markdown
## Task Description
Add a health system to the player character

## Detailed Steps
1. Create res://player/health.gd with Health class
2. Add max_health (100) and current_health properties
3. Implement take_damage(amount) method
4. Implement heal(amount) method (max at max_health)
5. Add health_changed signal

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Health class exists with all methods
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Signal emits correctly

## Complexity
medium
```

Add the `ready` label and the system will pick it up within 60 seconds.

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# Check system status
./wizard.sh --status

# View logs
journalctl -u issue-watcher -f
journalctl -u godot-server -f

# Health check
./wizard.sh --health
```

### Managing the System

```bash
./wizard.sh --status          # Current state
./wizard.sh --upgrade         # Move to next phase
./wizard.sh --health          # Run diagnostics
./wizard.sh --repair          # Fix issues
./wizard.sh --weekly-review   # Progress report
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Morning routine (5 minutes)
gh issue create --template task --title "Add pause menu" --label "ready"
gh issue create --template task --title "Fix jump physics" --label "ready"
gh issue create --template task --title "Add sound effects" --label "ready"

# Check at lunch (2 minutes)
gh pr list  # Review created PRs
gh pr review 123 --approve

# Evening (5 minutes)
git pull
# Test merged changes
# Plan tomorrow's tasks
```

## Key Concepts

### Godot Server

HTTP API that queues and executes Godot tests sequentially, preventing conflicts when multiple agents need to run tests.

```
Claude Agent 1 ──┐
Claude Agent 2 ──┼──> Godot Server → Single Godot Process
Claude Agent 3 ──┘
```

### Issue-Driven Tasks

Tasks are defined as GitHub/GitLab issues, not files. This provides:
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Permanent history
- Rich formatting (markdown, code blocks)
- Native PR linking

### Test Retry Logic

If tests fail, Claude gets the error message and tries to fix it. Default: 3 retries (4 total attempts). Success rate: ~90-95%.

### Git Worktrees

Each task gets its own isolated git worktree, preventing conflicts and allowing easy cleanup.

## Security

**Critical: Follow security guidelines in [Docs/Design/security-baseline.md](Docs/Design/security-baseline.md)**

- Secrets stored in `~/.config/lazy_birtd/secrets/` (chmod 600)
- Claude agents run in Docker containers
- Services bind to localhost or VPN only
- API tokens never committed to git
- Regular secret rotation (90 days)

## Cost Estimate

- **Phase 1:** $50-100/month (Claude API)
- **Phase 2-3:** $100-150/month
- **Phase 4+:** $150-300/month

Budget limits and alerts included to prevent surprises.

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks not being processed

```bash
# Check issue watcher
systemctl status issue-watcher

# Verify API token
./tests/phase0/test-api-access.sh

# Check for issues with "ready" label
gh issue list --label "ready"
```

### Tests failing

```bash
# Check Godot Server
systemctl status godot-server

# View test logs
cat /var/lib/lazy_birtd/tests/latest/output.log

# Test gdUnit4
godot --headless -s addons/gdUnit4/bin/GdUnitCmdTool.gd --help
```

### General issues

```bash
# Run wizard diagnostics
./wizard.sh --health

# Auto-repair common problems
./wizard.sh --repair

# Check all logs
journalctl -u godot-server -f
journalctl -u issue-watcher -f
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does this really work?**
A: The architecture is sound, but relies on Claude Code CLI working in headless mode. Run Phase 0 validation first to verify.

**Q: Is it safe?**
A: Yes, with proper setup. Claude runs in Docker containers, uses git worktrees, and has permission restrictions. Follow security baseline.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Claude API costs vary. Expect $50-300/month depending on usage. Budget limits prevent overages.

**Q: Can I use it with other game engines?**
A: Currently designed for Godot, but architecture is adaptable. Would need engine-specific test integration.

**Q: Does it work on Windows?**
A: Yes, via WSL2. Native Windows support is experimental.

**Q: What if Claude breaks something?**
A: Tests catch most issues. Changes are in isolated worktrees and PRs for review. Nothing merges without approval.
